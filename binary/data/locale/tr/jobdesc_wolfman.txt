Lycans are formidable wolf[ENTER]
creatures which were once[ENTER]
infected by an incurable[ENTER]
virus, losing their human[ENTER]
forms and mutating into[ENTER]
beasts. Thanks to their[ENTER]
unbridled power and[ENTER]
heightened instincts they[ENTER]
make exceptional close[ENTER]
combat fighters. Fearless in[ENTER]
the face of conflict, they[ENTER]
always seek out the front[ENTER]
lines.
